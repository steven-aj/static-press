> [!NOTE]
> StaticPress is derived from [Alex Fazio](https://github.com/afazio1)'s original work on [Obsidian Markdown Blogger](https://github.com/afazio1/obsidian-markdown-blogger) and has been heavily modified for a more feature-rich experience. 
> If you prefer a more simple, command-based tooling - please check out and support her work.

**StaticPress** is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin built for users who enjoy managing static-site content from within a vault. It handles pushing markdown files from your vault to a target directory of choice - no fluff, no lock-in, no online service required.

- Define destination paths for each vault folder.
- No versioning, no git magic - just direct overwrite for now.

Built for devs, writers, and tinkerers who want their notes to *be* their site content without fighting their tools.

> [!CAUTION]
> **StaticPress is _not_ currently a version control system**. 
> Files are completely overwritten when pushed

## âœ¨ Features
### Vault-to-Project Routing

Specify destination paths for each folder within your Vault

### Seamlessly Migrate Content

**Push** your markdown with a single click when you're ready to publish.

### Automatic Slugs

Toggle **automatic slug** generation on a folder-by-folder basis. (ex.: 'Why StaticPress Rocks' -> 'why-staticpress-rocks') 

## :gear: Usage

After enabling the plugin, go to StaticPress' settings.
- Define routing paths for the contents of your vault. **Paths must be absolute**.

### :video_game: Command Palette

#### Push Command
Creates or overwrites a file at location `/PROJECT_PATH/<note_name>.md` with the current working document.
