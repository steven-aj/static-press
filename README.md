# StaticPress

> [!NOTE]
> StaticPress is derived from [Alex Fazio](https://github.com/afazio1)'s original work on [Obsidian Markdown Blogger](https://github.com/afazio1/obsidian-markdown-blogger) and has been heavily modified for a more feature-rich experience. 
> If you prefer a more simple, command-based tooling - please check out and support her work.

**StaticPress** is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin built for users who enjoy managing static-site content from within a vault. It handles pushing and pulling markdown files between your vault and a target directory of choice - no fluff, no lock-in, no online service required.

- Define destination paths for each vault folder. 
- Sync raw markdown back and forth. 
- No versioning, no git magic - just direct overwrite for now.

Built for devs, writers, and tinkerers who want their notes to *be* their site content without fighting their tools.

> [!CAUTION]
> **StaticPress is _not_ currently a version control system**. 
> Files are completely overwritten when pushed or pulled.

## âœ¨ Features
### Vault-to-Project Routing
